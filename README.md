# Agricultural-Crop-Yield-Analysis

📌 Objective
This project aims to analyze and visualize agricultural crop yield trends across various Indian states over multiple years. The goal is to identify crop performance patterns, regional productivity variations, and historical changes using interactive Power BI dashboards.

🔧 Tools Used
Power BI for interactive dashboards and data visualization

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

📊 Key Features / Tasks
1. Crop-wise Yield Aggregation
Summarized total/average yield per crop across all states.

2. Year-wise Trends
Visualized how crop yields have changed over the years using bar/line charts.

3. State-wise Mapping
Used a geographic map visual to show yield distribution across Indian states.

4. Slicers & Filters
Added slicers for:

Crop

Year

State

Enables users to explore data dynamically.

📈 Outcome
The dashboard provides:

A bar/line chart showing yield trends over years.

A state-wise map visualizing average or total yield.

Interactive filters for detailed exploratory analysis.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Performed using Power Query:

Removed nulls and blanks

Ensured correct data types:

Year → Whole Number

Yield → Decimal Number

Verified geographic data (State) was categorized properly as “State or Province”

🗺️ Notes on Map Visualization
Ensured Power BI recognized Indian states correctly
